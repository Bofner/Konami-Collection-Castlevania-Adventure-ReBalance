 ## Note:
 This is an Autoboot for Castlevania Adventure as well as a balance patch, so you don't have to
 scroll through the menus on the collection anymore to play ReBalance. 
 
 ## Alterations:
 
 -Increased movement speed: This causes Christopher to not only walk faster, but causes the screen to scroll more quickly, and increases the length of his jump, making those brutal pixel-perfect jumps much more manageable.
 
 -Increased movement speed of the horizontally scrolling spike wall on stage 3 and the walk speed of the small knights on stage 4: This is to compensate for Christopher's increased mobility.
 
 -Changed the way the whip is downgraded: Whip will start off at leather. The chain whip will only drop to leather upon death. The fire shot still disappears upon taking damage.
 
 -Changed the speed of the Punaguchi's ball projectile: The ball now moves at a speed comparable to the speed in Castlevania Belmont's Revenge, and is much easier to predict and react to now.
 
 -Decreased Christopher's hitbox: Made a more accurate hitbox for Christopher's body, leading to fewer undeserved hits
 
 -Changed the Game Over checkpoint for the final fight with Dracula: Checkpoint has been changed from the beginning of Stage 4 to just before the battle with The Count.
 
 -Changed the title screen to include the subtitle ReBalance.
